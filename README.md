# fitness-app
An ongoing project focused on creating a general fitness app and focusing on improving principles and practices

## General Goals
- Focus on improving principles and practices
- Have a weekly write-up and optionally a weekly product explaining what happened
- Focus more on "Throw-away prototyping" to get early functionality
- Make something that works for me rather than focusing on perfection
- Focus on early requirements elicitation rather than taking everything on from the start
