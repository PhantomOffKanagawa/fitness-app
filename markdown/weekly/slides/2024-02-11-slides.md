#### First week of
# Fitness App

<!--This marks the completion of my first week working on this project in a "proper" manner. While I wasn't able to get too much done, I do feel I have a solid starting ground and should I lose interest in completing the project I have something to return to and at least have documentation I feel I can be proud of... at least in comparison to my usual lone bare bones README.-->

## Quote of the Week
 
 ###### "The best-laid schemes o’ mice an’ men gang aft a-gley"
_You can only control what you can control_

<!-- To sum up this first week: "The best-laid plans of mice and men oft go astray." Despite trying to do this project in a more planned out manner than I generally follow, I had an increasingly hectic week of meetings and classes. While I worked to outline the requirements of my project, I also like to have some tangible and quickly moved to creating a prototype but immediately ran out of time to do work on this "side" project. Striking a balance of proper documentation against my older habits of jumping to working will be a learning experience. -->

## Symbolic Links

- Wanted: Access to .md documentation in Obsidian
- Issue: Files were in `/Documents/Code`
- Solution: Symbolic Linking  
 ㅤ
 ㅤ
 
 `mklink /D LinkLocation TargetDir`

<!-- I wanted to access my markdown documentation in Obsidian as it is my markdown app of choice and tricked out to do all the random things I could want (it is what this slide was written with). But I keep my code in a specific folder and did not want to have a separate Obsidian vault for every project moving forward or the bloat that comes with it. And so after some brief research I landed on making a symbolic link between the two folders so that I can access it in Obsidian with all of my templates and plug-ins but still keep the files themselves in the git repo in my Code folder. -->

## Marp
- Obsidian Advanced Slides were too limited in layouts
- Marp seems a suitable open-source & portable alternative
- Good theme, few issues
ㅤ
ㅤ
```yaml
theme: uncover
class: invert
style: section { background-color: #121212; }
```

<!-- My original plan was to use the advanced slides plug-in for Obsidian and I may yet return to it but its functionality was too limited as I was unable to change things like the aspect-ratio. So I am instead test-piloting Marp as the other "Markdown Presentation Ecosystem" that I knew of. It still has issues like blank spaces seemingly only being possible with a newline and a blank "ㅤ" character but hopefully it seems far more configurable so I will be able to improve as I go.  -->

## The Actual Program
#### The Food Object
- Food
	- String -name
	- Integer -calories, -carb, -protein, -fat
	- Float -minQuantity, -maxQuantity, -step

<!-- But getting to the real project, the Food Object is the very center of the main functionality I am looking for. It needs to at minimum track it's name and basic macros. Additionally, I've decided to add more details so you can describe how much or little of that food you would eat in a day so meal plan generation can be more adaptable. This is done by setting a low and high bound, and then having a "step". This is deliberately vague to allow the step to be a gram, ml, serving, 1/2 serving, or whatever fits the case and it should all act the same -->

</style>
#### Meals Object
ㅤ
- FoodWrapper
	- Food -food
	- Integer -quantity
ㅤ
- Meal
	- String -name
	- FoodWrapper\[] - foods
	- Float -minQuantity, -maxQuantity, -step

<!-- An optional, but very important element is "meal". These act as groups of foods that can be entered as one item, making adding something like a pasta dish or smoothie a smoother experience. A Meal has a name, the same bounds and step as a Food object, and a list of FoodWrapper objects to track what is in the meal. While I am not in love with the necessity of the Wrapper, I could not think of a better way to hold both the food and quantity per meals. If the implementation continues to be JSON, this does not have to be its own discrete object and can just be part of the Meal objects. -->

#### User Settings
- int -calorieGoal (positive <5000)
- int -carbGoal (positive <5000)
- int -proteinGoal (positive <5000)
- int -fatGoal (positive <5000)

<!-- While I am sure that more User Settings will appear as the need arises, the only ones I have seen need for persisting so far is the goals to hit for each of the macros that will be tracked. In the future fancier options are generating this from other user information or tracking meal splits, meal counts, etc. but for now I am keeping it simple with just these four goals. -->

## Prototyping
![Image of AddFood Menu Prototype](2024-02-11-slides02182024.png)

<!-- I did not have a lot of time to work on the AddFood Menu prototype so it is still very barebones, though thank you bootstrap for making bare bones looks so good. I definitely need to work to getting this in a functioning state rather than just a pretty html file, but for the time I had it is a solid step and I did my best to make it properly and ensure I understood how it was built as I built it rather than just changing things till it worked. -->

# That's It For This Week

<!-- I wrote out a lot more "Requirements Elicitation" than I ever have before and actually managed to make this product which I am rather proud of. I have a system in place to continue working and a start in both documentation and prototyping. While I am worried I will not have a lot of time for this as I have exams, assignments, quizzes, and events coming up, I am glad I have this all finished. -->

### About This

- Github: [https://github.com/PhantomOffKanagawa](https://github.com/PhantomOffKanagawa)
- LinkedIn: _I really got to get to that_
- Text Editor: VS Code & Obsidian
- Slides: Marp

<!-- I do not know if this is ever going to become an actual series like a video series or something (thought this first week almost certainly will not given my zero plans to record this to a video). But if someone stumbles upon this or I do ever decide to record it: here are my links. I use VS Code as my Code Editor and cannot recommend Obsidian enough as a text editor. These slides were made with Marp and this has been my First Week Product for my Fitness App product. -->
